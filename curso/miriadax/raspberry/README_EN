DANGER!!!
DON'T CHANGE THE NAMES OR PATH OF THE FILES AND DIRECTORIES.
MOST OF THE PROGRAMS NEED ANOTHER PROGRAM TO WORK


IS RECOMENDED TO LAUNCH PROGRAMS FROM THE PROGRAM DIRECTORY

for example instead of run:    ./programa/lanzainicio.py
          you must run:    cd programa
                   and:    ./lanzainicio.py

            instead of run:    ~/folder/programa/lanzainicio.py
          you must run:    cd ~/folder/programa
                   and:    ./lanzainicio.py


for example instead of run:    python3 programa/lanzainicio.py
          you must run:    cd programa
                   and:    python3 lanzainicio.py

            instead of run:    python 3 ~/folder/programa/lanzainicio.py
          you must run:    cd ~/folder/programa
                   and:    python3 lanzainicio.py
                        

In folder 'programa' are the files of the program
In folder 'instalacion' are the files you need before first use / automatization
In folder 'automatizacion' are the files you need for create a automatization
   file, this file have the orders and the time it be launched.

*crontab file is the file that make all the programs run alone (it created by
   'automatizacion' program

FIRST STEPS
1. Read the documentation of the programs because some programs will change
   crontab and if you use the user crontab for doing something about user it
   will change it. And read the documentation in the programs. All the
   programs are commented.

2. Install the libraries. (You can do it with any of the programs in the
   'instalacion' folder).

3. Try the programs in order. (After reading the documentation)
    Order:
	1: Programs in the 'programa/inicio/' folder.
	   You must kill this programs before use'programa/lanzasensores.py'
	   You must use in background if you want to use with other programs.
        2: Program 'programa/lanzainicio.py'.
	3: Program 'programa/hayinicio.py'. If 'programa/lanzainicio.py' was
	   launched it creates a temporary folder.
           It it wasn't launched it lauch it.
	4: Program 'programa/dcmotor.py'. In background.
              Arguments:
		First 0: Stop
		First 1: Left, Second: Value from 0 to 1 -> Speed
		First 2: Right, Second: Value from 0 to 1 -> Speed
	5: Program 'programa/lanzasensores.py'. Scan the values of sensors and
           upload the values to carriots server.
	6: Programs in 'programa/servo' folder. They need an argument.
	7: Programs in 'programa/rele' folder. They need an argument.
	8: Program 'programa/deletemovil.py'. Deletes a stream.
	   It need an argument, the id that we are going to delete.
        9: Program 'programa/sacarmovil.py'. Read the values that the app
	   send to the carriots server.
       10: Program 'programa/eliminasensores.py'. Deletes old streams
	   from sensors.


ABOUT PROGRAMS
1. The programs must be used with the necesary parameters in case of
   using parameters, there is no comprobation of correct parameters
   because it must be launched by a program that put the correct range of
   parameters, or the user must be read how the program must be launched.
2. You have specific documentation in the folder of the programs and in the
   comments of the programs.
