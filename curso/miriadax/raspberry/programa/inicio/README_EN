In this folder we have 5 programs.

1.- boton.py: In this script we save in a temporary file the system time every
              time the button has been pressed. (The file has the last time
              the button has been pressed)

2.- led.py:   In this script we read the values for the led from a file and
              put the intensity of this values in the led to get the color
              that we put for the led.

3.- line.py:  In this script we save in two temportary files the system time
              every time the IR sensor change from no detect nothing to detect
              someting (line file, it has the last time the IR changes from no
              detect to detect something) and the system time every time the
              IR sensor change from detect something to no detect nothing
              (noline file, it has the last time the IR changes from detect
              something to no detect nothing)

4.- motor.py: In this script we save the pid of this process, because when we
              kill the program we don't send nothing to the motor, and when we
              change the values of the motor we kill the program and launch
              again with the new values.

5.- rele.py:  In this script we read a file that contains the value of the
              rele. (The rele that we use is a 2 reles board) and it has a
              2 digits value, one digit for one rele and other digit for the
              other. Values are 0 off and 1 on.
