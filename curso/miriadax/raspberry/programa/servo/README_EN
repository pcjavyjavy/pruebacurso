In this folder are the programs to control servo motor.
You must configure the maximun an minimun aperture of the servo in the files
   because the servo motor is controlled by a pulse and the duration of the
   pulse determines the angle.

   ->abrirycerrar.py -> open (put the servo to the maximun angle) and close
                        (put the servo to the minimun angle if parameter is
                        greather than 0), the receives a parameter, the
                        parameter is the time between the servo is 'open' and
                        the servo is 'closed', if parameter is 0 the servo
                        don't 'close'

   ->angularservo.py -> put the servo in a determinate angle, the angle is a
                        parameter that the program receive. The angle must be
                        between 0 and 180
